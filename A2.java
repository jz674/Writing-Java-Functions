	/* Implementation notes:
	 *
	 * Wherever possible, prefer library functions to writing your own loops.
	 *
	 * The more complicated your loops become, the more important it is to explain
	 * the logic in comments. We don't explain break and continue. We prefer that
	 * you don't use them.
	 *
	 * When writing comments within a method body, you may find it useful to
	 * use multi-line comments to describe WHAT the code doing, and single-line
	 * comments to describe HOW it is doing it. For example:
	 *
	 *    /* Remove the unfrobnicatable whizbangs * /
	 *    for (...)
	 *        // NOTE: a whizbang is frobnicatable if it has two or more tails
	 *        ...
	 *
	 *    /* Frobnicate all the remaining whizbangs * /
	 *    for (...)
	 *        ...
	 */

	/* Notes on Java if statements and loops:
	 *
	 * Write an if statement like this:
	 *
	 *     if (boolean-expression) {
	 *         do this if boolean-expression is true
	 *     }
	 *
	 * Write an if-else statement like this:
	 *
	 *     if (boolean-expression) {
	 *         do this if boolean-expression is true
	 *     } else {
	 *         do this if boolean-expression is false
	 *     }
	 *
	 * Write a while-loop like this:
	 *
	 *    while ( boolean-expression ) {
	 *        repetend (the loop body, "the thing to be repeated")
	 *    }
	 *
	 * To execute the while-loop, do the following:
	 *
	 *   1. Evaluate the boolean-expression; if it is false, stop.
	 *   2. Execute the repetend.
	 *   3. Continue again at step 1.
	 *
	 * Write a for-loop to do-something several times, with i having values in
	 * m..n-1 (i.e. with i being m, m+1, m+2, ..., n-1). 
	 *
	 *    for (int i= m; i < n; i= i+1) {
	 *        repetend
	 *    }
	 *
	 * The for-loop above is equivalent to the while-loop below, except that
	 * local variable i is NOT usable after the loop; its scope is its assignment
	 * together with the loop.
	 *
	 *    int i= m;
	 *    while (i < n) {
	 *        repetend
	 *        i= i+1;
	 *    }
